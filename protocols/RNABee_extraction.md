## RNA Extraction with RNA-Bee

This document describes the general extraction of RNA using RNABee and Chloroform to extract and purify RNA. 
This protocol has been adopted from:
[Murray et al, 2015](https://mbio.asm.org/content/6/6/e01603-15) 
and 
[Cornforth et al, 2019](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/E5125).

## Materials Required:

    RNABee  
    Chloroform   
    1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes (DNA Lowbind)  
    Bead Beating tubes  
    Beads for bead beating tubes  
    MagnaLyzer  
    Microcentrifuge (cooled to +4°C)  
    Bioanalyzer or Agarose gel(1.5%) for QC  
    RNase Zap  
    75-80% ice-cold Ethanol (Freshly prepared)  
    Linear Acrylamide (5mg/mL)  
    Beta-mercaptoethanol
    Isopropanol

### *Notes before you begin*:
```
- Clean entire lab space(bench, pipettes, bottles, etc.) 
  with RNAse Zap. 
- If working in the open, work under a flame to prevent 
  contamination. 
- ALWAYS use gloves and avoid breathing on samples. 
- Keep EVERYTHING on ice while performing the extraction. 
- Be quick! Samples should not be in the phenol for more than 1hr.
- Prepare all reagents and label all tubes before you begin!
```

## 1. Prepare Extraction Materials

### *Prepare RNA-Bee, Isopropanol, and Chloroform (Fume Hood)*

1. In a fume hood, pour 1mL of RNABee per sample into a 15 or 50 mL conical tube. Use the markings on the side of the  tube to judge the amount of RNABee ± ~200 μL.
2. Add 10 μL β-mercaptoethanol (14.3 M) per 1 mL RNABee to the RNA-Bee working solution.
3. Place the RNA-Bee solution on ice.
4. Aliquot 0.5 mL isopropanol per sample into a 15 or 50 mL conical tube. Put this on ice.
5. Place chloroform on ice (I use a aliquot of ~25mL in a 50mL screw-cap glass jar, which I reuse)

### *Prepare Lysis Tubes*
1. Add large beads to the bead-beating tubes until ~1/3 full. 
2. Add small beads to fill the spaces between the big beads.
    - Label tubes on the side, not the top! 
    - DO NOT label the top, as it will rub off. 
    - For *in vitro* bacteria culture: No need to add large beads.

## 2. Cell Lysis and RNA-Bee Extraction

1. Add sample to the bead beating tube. 
2. Add 1mL RNA bee to the bead-beating tube containing the sample. 
3. Place tubes in the MagnaLyzer and bead-beat ( for 3 x 30 seconds, intensity=7000) Place tubes on ice between each run.
4. In the fume hood, add 200 μL chloroform / 1mL RNA-Bee to each tube.
5. Shake the tube for ~ 45 seconds. Incubate on ice for 5 min.
6. Centrifuge for 30 min @ 13,000g in a pre-cooled centrifuge.
7. Carefully remove the tubes...Do not disrupt the pase-seperation!
8. In the fume hood, use a 1mL pipette and transfer the upper, aqueous layer to a clean 1.5mL tube. Leave 50-100 μL of the aq layer to avoid phenol contamination.
9. Add 0.5mL 2-propanol per 1mL RNA Bee used to the aq phase.
10. Add 2uL linear acrylamide. Invert the tube several times to mix. 
11. Precipitate these tubes at -80°C overnight. 

## 3. RNA Cleanup
1. Thaw the samples on ice. 
2. Spin down the samples for 30 min @ 13,000g in a pre-cooled centrifuge.
3. Discard the supernatant.The RNA should form a white-ish pellet. (May not be visible)
4. Add 1mL 75-80% ice-cold ethanol. Try to dislodge the pellet by vortexing or rubbing on tube-holder. 
5. Centrifuge again and repeat wash step. 
6. After final wash, air dry the pellet for ~10 mins. Less time for small pellet. Don't let the pellet dry out.
7. Resuspend the pellet in 20-100uL nuclease free water.
8. Measure concentration and store at -80C
