## RNA Extraction with Trizol

This document describes the general extraction of RNA using Trizol and Chloroform to extract and purify RNA. 
This protocol has been adopted from:
[Murray et al, 2015](https://mbio.asm.org/content/6/6/e01603-15) 
and 
[Cornforth et al, 2019](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/22/E5125).

## Materials Required:

    Trizol  
    Chloroform   
    1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes (DNA Lowbind)  
    Bead Beating tubes  
    Beads for bead beating tubes  
    MagnaLyzer  
    Microcentrifuge (cooled to +4°C)  
    Bioanalyzer or Agarose gel(1.5%) for QC  
    RNase Zap  
    75-80% ice-cold Ethanol (Freshly prepared)  
    Linear Acrylamide (5mg/mL)  
    Beta-mercaptoethanol
    Isopropanol

### *Notes before you begin*:
```
- Clean entire lab space(bench, pipettes, bottles, etc.) 
  with RNAse Zap. 
- If working in the open, work under a flame to prevent 
  contamination. 
- ALWAYS use gloves and avoid breathing on samples. 
- Keep EVERYTHING on ice while performing the extraction. 
- Be quick! Samples should not be in the phenol for more than 1hr.
- Prepare all reagents and label all tubes before you begin!
- Don't overload the Trizol. Only a 5-10 mm<sup>3</sup> biopsy is needed.

## 1. Prepare Extraction Materials

### *Prepare Trizol, Isopropanol, and Chloroform (Fume Hood)*

1. In a fume hood, pour 1mL of Trizol per sample into a 15 or 50 mL conical tube. Use the markings on the side of the  tube to judge the amount of Trizol ± ~200 μL.
2. Add 10 μL β-mercaptoethanol (14.3 M) per 1 mL Trizol to the Trizol working solution.
3. Place the Trizol solution on ice.
4. Aliquot 0.5 mL isopropanol per sample into a 15 or 50 mL conical tube. Put this on ice.
5. Place chloroform on ice (I use a aliquot of ~25mL in a 50mL screw-cap glass jar, which I reuse)

### *Prepare Lysis Tubes*
1. Add large beads to the bead-beating tubes until ~1/3 full. 
2. Add small beads to fill the spaces between the big beads.
    - Label tubes on the side, not the top! 
    - DO NOT label the top, as it will rub off. 
    - For *in vitro* bacteria culture: No need to add large beads.

## 2. Cell Lysis and Trizol Extraction

1. Add sample to the bead beating tube. 
2. Add 1mL RNA bee to the bead-beating tube containing the sample. 
3. Place tubes in the MagnaLyzer and bead-beat (for 3 x 30 seconds, intensity=7000) Place tubes on ice between each run.
4. In the fume hood, add 200 μL chloroform / 1mL Trizol to each tube.
5. Shake the tube for ~ 45 seconds. Incubate on ice for 5 min.
6. Centrifuge for 30 min @ 13,000g in centrifuge pre-cooled to +4°C.
7. Carefully remove the tubes...Do not disrupt the pase-seperation!
8. In the fume hood, use a 1mL pipette and transfer the upper, aqueous layer to a clean 1.5mL tube. Leave ~100 μL of the aq layer to avoid phenol contamination.
9. Add 0.5mL isopropanol per 1mL Trizol used to the aq phase.
10. Add 2uL linear acrylamide. Invert the tube several times to mix. 
11. Precipitate the tubes at -20°C for 1-2 hours. ALternatively, preciptate overnight at -80°C. 

## 3. RNA Cleanup
1. Spin down the samples for 30 min @ 13,000g in a pre-cooled centrifuge.
2. Discard the supernatant.The RNA should form a white-ish pellet. (May not be visible)
3. Add 1mL 75-80% ice-cold ethanol. Try to dislodge the pellet by vortexing or rubbing on tube-holder. 
4. Centrifuge again and repeat wash step. 
5. After final wash, air dry the pellet for ~10 mins. Less time for small pellets. Don't let the pellet dry out.
6. Resuspend the pellet in 20-100uL nuclease free water.
7. Measure concentration and store at -80C
