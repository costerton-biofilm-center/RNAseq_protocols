## RNA Extraction with Trizol

This document describes the general extraction of RNA from tissue sampes using Trizol
reagent. 

## Materials Required:
    Trizol Reagent (should be COLD)  
    Chloroform  
    1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes (Eppendorf DNA Lowbind)  
    Bead Beating tubes (should be ~1/4 full of beads. Tissue: 0.1 and 2mm beads. Bac culture: Only 0.1mm beads)  
    Silica/Zirconia beads (Biospec: 0.1mm(cat: 11079101z), 2mm (cat:11079124zx) 
    MagnaLyzer  
    Microcentrifuge (cooled to +4°C)  
    Bioanalyzer or Agarose gel(1.5%) for QC  
    RNase Zap  
    75-80% ice-cold Ethanol (Freshly prepared)  
    Linear Acrylamide (5mg/mL)  
    Beta-mercaptoethanol (optional)
    Isopropanol (Molecular Biology Grade)

### *Notes before you begin*:
```
- Clean entire lab space(bench, pipettes, bottles, etc.) 
  with RNAse Zap. 
- If working in the open, work under a flame to prevent 
  contamination. 
- ALWAYS use gloves and avoid breathing on samples. 
- Keep EVERYTHING on ice while performing the extraction. 
- Be quick! Samples should not be in the phenol for more than 1hr.
- Prepare all reagents and label all tubes before you begin!
```
## 1. Prepare Extraction Materials

### *Prepare Trizol, Isopropanol, and Chloroform (Fume Hood)*

1. In a fume hood, pour 0.8mL of Trizol per sample into a 15 or 50 mL conical tube. Use the markings on the side of the  tube to judge the amount of Trizol ± ~200 μL.
2. (OPTIONAL) Add 10 μL β-mercaptoethanol (14.3 M) per 1 mL Trizol to the Trizol working solution.
3. Place the Trizol solution on ice.
4. Aliquot 0.5 mL isopropanol per sample into a 15 or 50 mL conical tube. Put this on ice.
5. Place chloroform on ice (I use small 25mL glass containers of chloroform)

## 2. Cell Lysis and Trizol/Chloroform Extraction

1. Add sample to the bead beating tube. 
2. Add 0.8 mL Trizol to the bead-beating tube containing the sample. 
3. Place tubes in the MagnaLyzer and bead-beat ( for 3 x 30 seconds, intensity=7000) Place tubes on ice between each run.
4. In the fume hood, add 160 μL chloroform / 0.8 mL Trizol (200 uL chloroform/ 1 mL Trizol) to each tube.
5. Shake the tube for ~ 45 seconds. Incubate on ice for 5 min.
6. Centrifuge for 15 min @ 13,000g in a pre-cooled centrifuge.
7. Carefully remove the tubes...Do not disrupt the pase-seperation!
8. In the fume hood, use a 1mL pipette and transfer the upper, aqueous layer to a clean 1.5mL tube. Leave 50-100 μL of the aq layer to avoid phenol contamination.
9. Add 0.4 mL 2-propanol used to the aq phase (0.5 mL isop per 1mL Trizol used in extraction).
10. Add 2uL linear acrylamide. Invert the tube several times to mix. 
11. Incubate these tubes at -20 °C for 30 min - 1hr. 

## 3. Cleanup

1. Spin down the samples for 30 min @ 13,000g in a pre-cooled centrifuge.
2. Discard the supernatant.The RNA should form a clear/white-ish pellet. (May not be visible)
3. Add 1mL 75-80% ice-cold ethanol. Dislodge pellet by vortexing or by "rubbing" the tube on a microcentrifuge tube rack
4. Centrifuge again and repeat wash step. 
5. After final wash, air dry the pellet for ~10 mins. Less time for small pellet. Don't let the pellet dry out.
6. Resuspend the pellet in 20-100uL nuclease free water.
7. Measure concentration and store at -80C
